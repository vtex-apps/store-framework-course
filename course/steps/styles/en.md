## Introduction 

In addition to css, which we looked at previously, Store Framework offers another type of design customization, based on `style.json`. 

## Semantic styling

Every Store Framework block benefit from the same semantic styles definitions, based on [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/). 
In practice, it means that instead of having to change all button backgrounds to use color that you want, you just need to redefine the color of an `action-primary` `background`. Customizations using `style.json` tend a very big impact through css, since the store's visual identity across every page is usually maintained that way, without requiring a lot of changes. Therefore, use this tool whenever possible, thus avoiding unnecessary css overhead. 

## Investigating `style.json` 
### Colors

`styles/configs/style.json` can be confusing at first, because it contains all the style definitions that every Store Framework visual block uses. However, inspecting browser elements is usually a good way to identify which styles to change. For example, *right mouse click on any store button and select inspect*.

Looking at the side bar that opened in Chrome, we notice a couple of definitions, one of them being the button background color (#0f3e99):

In addition, if you inspect while hovering, you'll notice the *hover* color (#072c75): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18701182/69849774-5f193480-125c-11ea-82e2-f118c8014287.png) 

If we search the occurrences of both colors in `style.json`, we uncover that the colors we inspected are actually used as `action-primary` for the `hover-background` and `background`, for example. This gives us a better idea of where this definition may appear again. 

### Typography 

The process to discovering text semantics with editable fields is the same as the above, we can search for attributes such as font size, weight and family. When inspecting a level 1 heading for example, we notice that its size is 3 rem.

## Activity 



1. In `style.json`, replace every color occurrence that you find, substituting: 
- **#072c75** with **#45a6a3** 
- **#0F3E99** with **#52BAB7** 

2. Change the font size for a level 1 heading so that its height is now 2.5 rem.

The expected result is as it follows:
