# Info Card: Store Framework's call to action 

## :sparkles: **Branch:** infocard

## Introduction

A store needs a good *home page* to engage users, increasing session time and therefore conversion chances. To achieve this, several elements need to be used, such as promotional banners, shelves with highlights, about us material, etc. 

We have created the next block on the *home page* using a *call to action*. In Store Framework, we have a block designed for this purpose, called [**Info Card**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components/Info-Card).

## Info Card

Using the Info Card, you can create images which have links and buttons (top or side of the block) that direct the user's flow (*Call to action*).

Looking at the [documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components/info-card#blocks-api), we can see that:

- `isFullModeStyle` defines whether the *Call to Action (CTA)* is set above the banner;
- `textPosition` defines the position of the text;
- `textAlignment` defines the text's alignment;
- `imageUrl` defines which image will be used as banner;
- `headline` determines which text will be used as headline;
- `callToActionMode` allows to choose the *CTA* mode as either a link or a button;
- `callToActionText` defines the *CTA* text;
- `callToActionUrl` determines the URL to which it redirects;

We therefore have the following props:

```json
  {
    "store.home": {
      "blocks": [
        "rich-text",
        "info-card"
      ]
    },
    "rich-text": {
      "props": {
        "text": "*Hello, World!*",
        "textPosition": "RIGHT"
      }
    },
    "info-card": {
      "props": {
      "isFullModeStyle": false,
      "textPosition": "right",
      "imageUrl": "https://appliancetheme.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/cozinha-rosa-min.png",
      "headline": "Vintage Pink",
      "subhead": "Give your kitchen a boho style adding vintage apparels.<br>Available until January 2020.",
      "callToActionMode": "button",
      "callToActionText": "Explore",
      "callToActionUrl": "/sale/d",
      "textAlignment": "center"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Instancing blocks

You may have asked yourself: 
> "What if I wanted to have two different Info Cards?" 

It's possible through **block instancing**.

All block have pre-established names, but you can create block instances and define different ways in which the block types appear. After each block has been defined, simply place an '#' with an **arbitrary** name that makes, for example:

```json
  {
    "store.home": {
      "blocks": [
        "rich-text",
        "info-card#button-right"
      ]
    },
    ...
    "info-card#button-right": {
      "props": {
        "isFullModeStyle": false,
        "textPosition": "right",
        "imageUrl": "https://appliancetheme.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/cozinha-rosa-min.png",
        "headline": "Vintage Pink",
        "subhead": "Give your kitchen a boho style adding vintage apparels.<br>Available until January 2020.",
        "callToActionMode": "button",
        "callToActionText": "Explore",
        "callToActionUrl": "/sale/d",
        "textAlignment": "center"
      }
    }
  }
```

> **WARNING:** Throughout the course, you will notice several `...`, which you should not copy as it represents the progress achieved during previous steps.

## Activity

In the `home.jsonc` file, based on the code above, create the `info-card#button-left` right under the infocard: `info-card#button-right`. This new infocard must implement the following:

 1. The title must be `Shining chrome`
 2. A link type call-to-action with the following text instead of a button: `Go to Collection` 
 3. The following image `https://appliancetheme.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/cozinha-cinza-min.png`
 4. The following subtitle `Give your kitchen a cool style adding warm metallic finishes.<br>Available until January 2020.`
 5. Text to the left of the image (`textPosition`).

The expected result will look similar to this:
